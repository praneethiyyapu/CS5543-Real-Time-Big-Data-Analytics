Data science employs techniques and theories drawn from                 many fields within the broad areas of mathematics,
statistics, operations research information science, and computer science, including signal processing, probability

models, machine learning, statistical learning, data mining, database, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization,
predictive analytics, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, data compression, computer programming, artificial intelligence, and high

performance computing. Methods that scale to big data are of particular interest in data science, although the discipline is not generally considered to be restricted to such big data, and big data technologies are often focused on organizing and preprocessing the data instead of analysis. The development of machine learning has enhanced the growth and importance of data science.

Data science affects academic and applied


research in many domains,                                                          including machine translation, speech recognition,
robotics, search engines, digital economy, but also                          the biological sciences, medical informatics, health care, social sciences
and the humanities. It heavily influences economics, ,



business and                                                   finance.
From the business perspective, data science is an integral part of competitive intelligence,
a newly emerging field that encompasses a number of activities,                                 such as data mining and data analysis
